### Conclusion
Build proxy chain: browser --> burp --> ez(on vps) --> website.
The EZ proxy on VPS should be wrapped by `nohup`, otherwise the proxy would break down frequently.

The vulnerabilities with high threat mainly distributes in OA, fastjson/jackson and log4j2. Since i have not been familiar to these vulnerabilities yet, no substantial attack was made successfully. 

Found a sqli and a arbitrary file download vul.
