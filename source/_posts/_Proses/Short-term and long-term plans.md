- <span style="background:#d3f8b6"> In several months, before being a full member</span>
	- Web dev and databases: **spring** dev, **ASP.NET**, Access, Exchange...
	- Get more masterd in Pentesting, explore various tools
	- Vulnerability Analysis and Code review
		- review some open-source project like **ruoyi, discuz**
		- reproduce popular vulerabilities, **struts2, weblogic**, etc
	- **App pentesting**, **Windows/Linux Reverse**
	- **Intranet pentesting**, read some <font color="#ffc000">books</font>
	- Pratice with <font color="#92d050">SRCs</font>, hack sites as you like
	- <font color="#00b0f0">Get familiar in pentest anyway. Try to participate in a red team project</font>
	- Learn **Javascript**, **Windows**, **Powershell**, **Bash**
- <span style="background:#d2cbff">Do some Leading-edge things</span>
	- Formostly, **Auto-Pentesting** with **Deep-learning**, and other areas like <font color="#00b050">Trusted Computing</font>, try to read bunches of <font color="#00b0f0">papers</font> and work out your <font color="#ffc000">demos</font>
	- Pay attention to cutting-edge <font color="#92d050"><font color="#00b0f0">conferences</font></font> and papers
	- Therotically, learn <font color="#92d050">AI</font> and <font color="#92d050">programming</font> theroy like design patterns 
	- Study in an extensive way
		- **AI** and **Deep-learning**, work out of the basis
		- **Block chain**, complete your go project, learn about **Etherum dev**
		- **eBPF**, hook structures
		- **IoT**
	- <font color="#0070c0">Write technique essay and publish in your <font color="#00b050">blog</font>.</font>
	- <font color="#7030a0">Develop some exciting project and push them to your <font color="#92d050">repository</font>.  </font>

- <span style="background:#d4b106">Strengthen your basis</span>
	- Reverse engineering, Java security, penetration, red team and development are foundation of further progress.
	- Keep researching, keep recording

- <span style="background:rgba(136, 49, 204, 0.2)">Penetration</span>
	- Track and analyze middleware vulnerabilities. Track aliyun vulnerability announcement, analyze git commit, reproduce.

- <span style="background:#b1ffff">Future career propose</span>
	- Most hopefully, I wanna do cutting-edge, advanced study as future job given which the ***Innovation Institute*** is a good choice. <font color="#ff0000">Tianji-laboratory</font>, which dedicates in the attack-and-defense of mainstream middlewares and formostly had participated BlackHat conference, is the best choice.
	- I also like to dig into some difficult problems as the work in ***Competency Center*** provide. 
	- <font color="#92d050">Data Security</font> such as <font color="#92d050">SGX</font> seems amazing enough.
	- As another choice, ***Diging Vulnerability*** or ***IoT Security*** or ***Reverse Engineer*** are all not bad. :D
	- <font color="#92d050">Cloud Security</font> is said to be pretty promising than traditional directions like Red Team or Code Audit.

- <span style="background:rgba(5, 117, 197, 0.2)">Time Line</span>
	- Until July 2024, master web penetration and red team. Keep to research php and java code audit. Strive to dig some CVE and CNVD. Learn reverse engineering if necessary. Develop some exciting tools. Master Python, Java and Go language as well as design modes.
